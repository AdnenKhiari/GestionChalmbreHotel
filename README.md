   - Provides a dynamic and responsive user interface.
   - Integrates Framer Motion for fluid animations and transitions.

## Backend (Express.js with PL/SQL API)

### Features:

1. **API Development**:
   - Express.js is used to create RESTful APIs for room and offer management.

2. **Stored Procedures (PL/SQL)**:

- **PL/SQL**:
   - Provides powerful database capabilities for managing room and offer data.

## Nginx (Reverse Proxy)

- **Nginx**:
   - Serves as a reverse proxy server, handling requests and distributing traffic between the frontend and backend for improved performance and security.

## Oracle Database
